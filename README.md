ðŸ“Š **Project Overview**  

This project focuses on developing key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual analytics to monitor and improve diversity and inclusion practices, particularly gender balance across hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover metrics.

Our client, a telecom company, partnered with PwC Switzerland to address gender diversity challenges in leadership. Through this initiative, we analyzed workforce dynamics and presented insights via an interactive dashboard built in Power BI.
